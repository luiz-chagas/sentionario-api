Sentionario v2 API

This is an API developed in Node.js, Express and Mongodb.
My intention is to create a state-of-art API using these technologies following the Airbnb Style Guide and best practices.
Feel free to fork this project and use as a base for other APIs.

Sentionario is a tool for building dictionaries for sentiment analysis through colaboration.

Errors messages are written in Portuguese, everthing else is in English.
